# Waste sorting in Bristol

Even in a world comparison, the UK is at the top of the list in terms of how well it has achieved waste separation. But the relative complexity of sorting waste is often devastating. Every city in the UK has different rules for sorting waste, and each city's waste sorting guidelines are cumbersome. Improperly sorted rubbish in the UK can result in high fines, and many long-time residents are not very good at sorting because of the ease of error. The aim of this project is to provide a place for Bristol residents to check their knowledge of waste sorting through a fun point game to reinforce everyone's knowledge of sorting.

# Our idea

We want to match the corresponding waste through a "Where should the waste go" game, where the page will show the waste that needs help to be sorted and four different colored bins at the bottom. Users use their own knowledge to match rubbish to bins and each successful match will earn points for the user.

# Our users

Our website is currently focused on waste sorting in Bristol, so it is mainly aimed at UK residents living in Bristol.

# Stakeholders

The project is more of a public service project, so it focuses on raising awareness of waste separation and environmental protection in society. For more information, please refer to our subsequent document.
