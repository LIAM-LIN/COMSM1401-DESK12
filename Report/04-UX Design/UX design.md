# UX Design

We mainly divide the UX design into four parts.Product inspiration,source of demand,requirement analysis and prototype design.

#### Product inspiration:

Our initial project has several options, including donation steps, tram recommendation and rubbish classification. 
Donation steps are mainly recorded by users walking through users, and then uploaded to our game for donation. In this way people can obtain donation pointsï¼Œkeep exercise and reduce obesity. 
However, it is difficult to make statistics and the PC side can not count steps so that we give up. Tram recommendation is mainly to recommend new trams to users to simulate the fuel consumption and actual driving style of trams and fuel vehicles.We hope in this way we can reduce the use of fuel vehicles to protect environment.
But due to the few types of trams, the game is less interesting and abandoned. Finally, we chose rubbish classification to teach users how to classify Bristol rubbish.

#### Source of demand:

Our product design inspiration comes from the recent rubbish classification publicity in China. Since the implementation of rubbish classification in Shanghai, many residents have no idea because they don't know how to classify and can't distinguish the types of rubbish.
Therefore, we investigated the rubbish classification in Bristol and found that many details of the rubbish classification in Bristol are very troublesome and difficult to distinguish.
So, we hope to provide Bristol residents with a simple rubbish classification game to help them better classify their garbage.

#### Requirement analysis:

We interviewed several different types of users, including students and residents in Bristol. They didn't know about the classification methods of some residual drinks and waste toothbrushes in daily life, because they all gave wrong answers in our questionaire.
We found that users didn't know much about the basic rubbish classification knowledge in daily life. Therefore, we hope that through the game of bin and rubbish can matching to help users improve this knowledge. Meanwhile, we provide the corresponding introduction to popularize the knowledge of rubbish classification.

#### Prototype design:

In the prototype design, we focus on several key principles. It includes user centered, simplicity and consistency, reducing cognitive load, and iterative design.Our prototype is to let users log in first, and then they can enter the game of rubbish classification. In the game, users only need to match the right rubbish and rubbish can to participate in the game. If the answer is right, they can get 100 points. If the answer is wrong, they will lose 100 points. Due to the principle of simplicity, we give up using the complex login but through the simple input of user name to distinguish users. Then users can directly answer questions to participate in the game.
