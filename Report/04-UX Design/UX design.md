# UX Design

We mainly divide the UX design into four parts.Product inspiration,source of demand,requirement analysis and prototype design.

#### Product inspiration:

Our initial project has several options, including donation steps, tram recommendation and rubbish classification. 
Donation steps are mainly recorded by users walking through users, and then uploaded to our game for donation. In this way people can obtain donation pointsï¼Œkeep exercise and reduce obesity. 
However, it is difficult to make statistics and the PC side can not count steps so that we give up. Tram recommendation is mainly to recommend new trams to users to simulate the fuel consumption and actual driving style of trams and fuel vehicles.We hope in this way we can reduce the use of fuel vehicles to protect environment.
But due to the few types of trams, the game is less interesting and abandoned. Finally, we chose rubbish classification to teach users how to classify Bristol rubbish.

#### Source of demand:

Our product design inspiration comes from the recent garbage classification publicity in China. Since the implementation of garbage classification in Shanghai, many residents have a headache because they don't know how to classify and can't distinguish the types of garbage.
Therefore, we investigated the garbage classification in Bristol and found that many details of the garbage classification in Bristol are very troublesome and difficult to distinguish.
Therefore, we hope to provide Bristol residents with a simple garbage classification game to help them better classify their garbage.

#### Requirement analysis:

We interviewed several different types of users, including students and residents in Bristol. They didn't know about the classification methods of some residual drinks and waste toothbrushes in daily life, because they all gave wrong answers. 
We found that users didn't know much about the basic garbage classification knowledge in daily life, Therefore, we hope that through the game of garbage and garbage can matching, to help users improve this knowledge, and with the corresponding introduction, to popularize the knowledge of garbage classification.

#### Prototype design:

In the prototype design, we maintain the principle of simplicity and consistency, giving up the complex login, but through the simple input of user name to distinguish users, and can directly answer questions to participate in the game, correct score, wrong score deduction.
