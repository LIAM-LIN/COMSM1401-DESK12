# Background and Motivation

Nowadays, nearly 90% of what we throw away could potentially be recovered through reuse, recycling or composting.[1]
What will get us as close to this percentage as possible is waste sorting.
According to the [Kerbside recycling guide](https://bristolwastecompany.co.uk/wp-content/uploads//2020/07/Pin-up-and-keep-recycling-guide-Bristol-Waste.pdf)
from the bristol waste company, in Bristol there are 40% of the waste that is completely discarded is recyclable,
and the energy required to recycle cans will be reduced by 95% - if they all get sorted!
Generally, sorting our recycling helps people collect it quicker, getting us off the roads and out of the way sooner, 
saving you and the city time and money.[2] 

I'm sure no one will disagree with you when you talk to people about the benefits of waste sorting，but there is still a huge gap between the will and the actual action! In fact,
one of the reasons why residents are reluctant to sort waste is that they have little knowledge about waste sorting and do not know how to sort waste correctly.[3]
This means that although people want to sort their waste, they don't know how to do it!
Research shows that waste sorting knowledge was positively and significantly associated with attitudes and perceived behavioral control.
Meanwhile, waste sorting knowledge was also positively and significantly associated with residents’ waste sorting intention, too.[4]
Based on this, we can see that if the knowledge of waste sorting is effectively communicated to the residents, the probability of waste sorting will be greatly increased.
Also, It is worth noting that some residents engage in waste sorting behaviour not because of their planned intention, but they simply come across good, accessible facilities and government stimulus.[5]
This shows that if people are given sufficient and interesting guidance, they will sort their waste, even if they don't have the will to do so at first.  

So, in which way can people nowadays acquire the knowledge of waste sorting that applies to where they live?
The most common and accurate way to find out is to go to the relevant local website. 
We found two websites where you can get accurate information about waste sorting in Bristol: [the Bristol's official government website](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/bins-recycling/what-goes-in-your-bins-and-boxes)
and [the Bristol Waste Company's website](https://bristolwastecompany.co.uk/household/get-it-sorted/). 
In these two websites you can get accurate information on waste sorting in Bristol, but the problem is you need to take the time and effort to read and study them.
In the Bristol's official government website, there are only extensive blocks of text that need to be read carefully.

In the Bristol Waste Company's website, things are better. There are easy-to-read, poster-style rules for sorting waste. But the problem is: you still have to read!

<div align=center><img width="300" src="https://github.com/LIAM-LIN/COMSM1401-DESK12/blob/main/Report/img/rules.png?raw=true" alt = "rules"/></div> <br/>

Before our time, of course, there are [games](https://recollect.net/waste-sorting-game/) for sorting waste. But these games were very crudely made and very old.
The biggest problem is that the rules for sorting waste in these games are inaccurate and do not apply to Bristol, so even if you finish the game, you will not get any useful knowledge about sorting waste!

The problem we are trying to solve then is  the residents of Bristol lack a fun and reliable way to make the process of learning about waste separation easy.
We tried to solve it by developing a game with a good user experience by strictly following Bristol's waste sorting rules.
By doing so, we can engage more residents in waste sorting and make Bristol a better place!
