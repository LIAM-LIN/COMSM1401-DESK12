#### Agile model:  

As the waterfall model is very unrealistic and requires additional planning and execution, we naturally went for the Agile model.
In our opinion, the waterfall model is only an idealized model used to illustrate the software development process.
In the real world, you can't and do not have to keep the development process so linear - I mean, why the trouble?
The waterfall model only works if the task is simple enough that you can see the end at the beginning - which becomes an agile model with only one iteration cycle!  

In our development process, we keep development iterations (sprints) to three to four days - which is pretty short but very exciting!
Here's how we did this：  
We often had a video meeting on Teams at the beginning and end of a sprint, which I believe was the best experience for every one of our collaboration.
During this meeting, We'll share what we did in our last sprint: what exciting functions we successfully implemented,
what skills and knowledge we acquired and even what interesting things happened in the last few days! 
We will then test and check what we have implemented together. During this process, We will discuss what technical difficulties we have encountered, 
what needs to be improved and what new ideas have come out of the sprint process. After this, we will finalise the plan for the next few days and assign tasks to each member.
Then a whole new sprint will begin!  
During one sprint, we communicate in detail mainly via WeChat. We discuss specific problems, exchange materials and share learning resources on WeChat.
It's very handy, and I recommend you try it!
