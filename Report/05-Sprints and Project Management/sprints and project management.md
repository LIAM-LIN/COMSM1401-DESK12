#### Agile model:  

As the waterfall model is very unrealistic and requires additional planning and execution, we naturally went for the Agile model.
In our opinion, the waterfall model is only an idealized model used to illustrate the software development process.
In the real world, you can't and do not have to keep the development process so linear - I mean, why the trouble?
The waterfall model only works if the task is simple enough that you can see the end at the beginning - which becomes an agile model with only one iteration cycle!  

In our development process, we keep development iterations (sprints) to three to four days - which is pretty short but very exciting!
Here's how we did thisï¼š  
We often had a video meeting on Teams at the beginning and end of a sprint, which I believe was the best experience for every one of our collaboration.
During this meeting, We'll share what we did in our last sprint: what exciting functions we successfully implemented,
what skills and knowledge we acquired and even what interesting things happened in the last few days! 
We will then test and check what we have implemented together. During this process, We will discuss what technical difficulties we have encountered, 
what needs to be improved and what new ideas have come out of the sprint process. After this, we will finalise the plan for the next few days and assign tasks to each member.
Then a whole new sprint will begin!  
During one sprint, we communicate in detail mainly via WeChat. We discuss specific problems, exchange materials and share learning resources on WeChat.
It's very handy, and I recommend you try it!

#### Team roles:

Rongxiang Lin: Leader. Responsible for the development of front-end web pages and the integration of materials. He pushed us forward!      

Terry Shi: Designer.Responsible for the prototype design and some development of front-end web pages.    

Shenxuan Yu: Developer. He collaborated with others to develop backends and APIs.   

Yingcan Wang: Developer. He was responsible for writing front pages of components in results and ranking parks. Besides, he wrote API with other developers.

Xueyan Hu: Researcher. He was responsible for collecting the photographic material and writing part of the report.

#### Sprints
**timeline:**    
09/02/2021 - 09/03/2021: Forming ideas and background research    
During this time period, we settled on the amazing idea for our group project - to help people know more about waste sorting. 
We then did some background research and decided to develop a game to help people understand the rules of waste sorting.

10/03/2021 - 31/03/2021: Prototyping, collecting materials and learning together     
During this time frame, we completed electronic and paper versions of the prototype drawings and collected the required materials. 
At the same time, we shared useful learning resources with each other and helped each other to learn from each other.

#### 17/04/2021:  **Start Sprint!!**
User story:   
Users want to be able to access web pages by typing the URL into their browser.   --Sprint??    

Users want to be able to enter their username and start the game by clicking the start button on the page.    --Sprint??

Users see a pop-up picture of the waste and the four waste separation bins.     --Sprint??

User clicks on the correct bin, add points, click on the wrong bin, deduct points.    --Sprint??

When users click on the wrong bin, they can see the correct answer and the corresponding rule explanation.     --This is a future work.    

Users can see their own points.    --Sprint??

Users sort ten separate pop-ups of waste, then jump to the results page.     --Sprint??

Users can click submit to submit their scores.    --Sprint??

Users click on the button and then ump to the leaderboard page.    --Sprint??

**Sprint1:**    
??components frontpage development??

**Sprint2:**
