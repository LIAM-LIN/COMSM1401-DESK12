# Stack Architecture and System Design

Our team is mainly divided into three pieces, design, front-end and back-end, so the unification of views between several of our teams is quite important, in the early stages of development by the design team to confirm the overall style of the site, functionality. Then we discussed the development tools together. We chose the MEAN stack architecture for our project, which includes MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS.

As it is a component-based development, we have a very consistent control of how each component relates to the back-end. We sketched out the process early on in the development process as shown below.
