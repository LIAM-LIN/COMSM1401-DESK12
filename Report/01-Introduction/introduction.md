## Abstract

Recycling trash is a great way to protect our environment and stimulate our economy,  and sorting our waste is extremely beneficial for recycling. However, it takes time and effort to learn the rules of waste sorting where you live, and the rules often vary from city to city. This learning process can also be tedious, as the positive impact of waste separation does not feed through to people immediately.  

So, our project is dedicated to helping people living in Bristol learn the local rules of waste sorting in an easy and fun way! We want to build a fun, user-friendly but strictly practical game to help us achieve this goal. 

In this game, there are four different coloured bins for recycling at the bottom of the game screen, corresponding to bristol's waste sorting rules. In the centre of the screen, pictures of various types of recyclable waste will pop up, and the user will then need to select a bin depending on the type of waste.  If correct, they will be awarded points. At the end of the game, a leaderboard will appear. As this game is only available to residents living in bristol, you may see familiar names on this leaderboard! If you are expert enough at sorting rubbish, others will also see your name on this leaderboard.

How cool would that be!

This project has two main high level goals. One is that the game should be fun and attractive enough, so it can attract residents to play and make the learning process easier.  The other is that the game should be close enough to real life and existing rules so that it can actually teach people the rules of waste sorting. Based on these two objectives, the evaluation checklist would then be:  

Fun and attractive:  
1.Nice and clean user interface with uniformly styled images of rubbish pictures.  
2.Sufficient and interesting positive feedback for users when they are right.  
3.A reliable and long-lasting leaderboard.  

Realistic and practical:  
1.Strict and accurate waste separation rules from official sources.  
2.Trash materials that are as close as possible to the normal life of the user.  
3.Accurate, clear and easy-to-read explanations of waste sorting rules when users make mistakes. 

## Project Objectives

In the meantime here are some of the target stages for our group to complete the project.
